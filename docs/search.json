    "section": "",
    "text": "The extinction of frugivores has been considered one of the main drivers of the disruption of important ecological processes, such as seed dispersal. Many defaunated forests are too small to restore function by reintroducing large frugivores, such as tapirs or Ateline monkeys, and the long-term fate of large-seeded plants in these areas is uncertain. However, such small fragments still host many species and play relevant ecosystem services. Here, we explore the use of two tortoise species, the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and the yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulatus), as ecological substitutes for locally extinct large seed dispersers in small forest patches in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We employed prior knowledge on the known occurrences of Chelonoidis species and used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify forest patches for tortoise rewilding. Based on habitat suitability, food availability and conservation co-benefits, we further refined our analysis and identified that the more suitable areas for tortoise reintroduction are forest patches of northern Atlantic Forest, areas with high defaunation intensity. Giant tortoises have been used to restore lost ecological services in island ecosystems. We argue that reintroducing relatively smaller tortoises is an easy-to-use/control conservation measure that could be employed to partially substitute the seed dispersal services of extinct large disperser species, mitigating the negative cascading effects of defaunation on reducing plant diversity.\nSOBRAL-SOUZA, T., LAUTENSCHLAGER, L., et al. (2017).

Here, we present the ATLANTIC MAMMALS, an open data set on information on medium- and large-sized mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. A total of 129 studies were compiled, including published and in press peer-reviewed papers, book chapters, theses and unpublished data. We mapped 244 assemblages, eight orders, 63 genera, and 94 species (24 of which are classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List) distributed in 128 protected and 116 unprotected areas. Species richness of the mammalian assemblages varied from 1 to 39 species (mean 15). The most recorded species in the entire biome was Dasypus novemcinctus, followed by Cerdocyon thous and Procyon cancrivorous. These data can be useful in support of macroecological studies and conservation planning strategies. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The landscape of fear has profound effects on the species behavior, with most organisms engaging in risk avoidance behaviors in areas perceived as riskier. Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans’ avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defaunation.\nMENDES, C. P., et al. (2020).

    "text": "Mammalian carnivores are considered a key group in maintaining ecological health and can indicate potential ecological integrity in landscapes where they occur. Carnivores also hold high conservation value and their habitat requirements can guide management and conservation plans. The order Carnivora has 84 species from 8 families in the Neotropical region: Canidae; Felidae; Mephitidae; Mustelidae; Otariidae; Phocidae; Procyonidae; and Ursidae. Herein, we include published and unpublished data on native terrestrial Neotropical carnivores (Canidae; Felidae; Mephitidae; Mustelidae; Procyonidae; and Ursidae). NEOTROPICAL CARNIVORES is a publicly available data set that includes 99,605 data entries from 35,511 unique georeferenced coordinates. Detection/non-detection and quantitative data were obtained from 1818 to 2018 by researchers, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private consultants. Data were collected using several methods including camera trapping, museum collections, roadkill, line transect, and opportunistic records. Literature (peer-reviewed and grey literature) from Portuguese, Spanish and English were incorporated in this compilation. Most of the data set consists of detection data entries (n = 79,343; 79.7%) but also includes non-detection data (n = 20,262; 20.3%). Of those, 43.3% also include count data (n = 43,151). The information available in NEOTROPICAL CARNIVORES will contribute to macroecological, ecological, and conservation questions in multiple spatio-temporal perspectives. As carnivores play key roles in trophic interactions, a better understanding of their distribution and habitat requirements are essential to establish conservation management plans and safeguard the future ecological health of Neotropical ecosystems. Our data paper, combined with other large-scale data sets, has great potential to clarify species distribution and related ecological processes within the Neotropics. There are no copyright restrictions and no restriction for using data from this data paper, as long as the data paper is cited as the source of the information used.

    "text": "The Atlantic Forest of South America hosts one of the world’s most diverse and threatened tropical forest biota. After five centuries of European human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. In this chapter, we describe the causes and consequences of large-scale defaunation in the Atlantic Forest of South America. We identify and quantify the magnitude of the main anthropogenic drivers of defaunation and stimulate a debate on how to revert the loss of fauna to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. The magnitude of the impact of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest is hard to estimate, but we can predict that, at large scale, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the most common threats to terrestrial populations. Other threats vary in importance according to the taxonomic group. In general, apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals, and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups and the loss of these animals has also a strong impact on the ecosystem services. Given the extent of the consequences of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest, mitigation strategies are imperative. Habitat restoration would clearly be effective in building space for defaunation mitigation but reversing the pervasive defaunation that occurred in the Atlantic Forest is by no means a straightforward task. Nonetheless, it will be fundamental to assure the persistence of the biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest remnants.\nGALETTI, M., et al. (2021).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Seed dispersal by frugivores is essential in plant life cycles, with birds and mammals the principal and well-studied dispersal agents.However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems. The red-footed tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria is one of the largest terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut retention time (GRT), and the post-consumption germination capacity for tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of 23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 ± 4.81 days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males. Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates. This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to defaunation processes.\nLAUTENSCHLAGER, L., SOUZA, Y., & GALETTI, M.

    "text": "Many animals eat fruits and then get rid of any seeds that they swallow through defecation (pooping). This can be good for plants because it moves seeds around, and the seeds can grow into new plants using the dung (poop) as compost. In some cases, many animals will poop in the same spot, creating “bathroom” areas called latrines that help them to bond with other individuals of their species, communicate, and mark their home regions. These latrines can also attract many other animals that eat seeds, insects, and even poop. Unfortunately, humans are causing many animals to become less common or even extinct as we destroy their habitats or hunt them for food and fur. If we lose these animals, we also lose all the good things they do for nature. We must protect natural habitats so these important animals can keep living—and pooping!\nLAUTENSCHLAGER, L. & FEELEY, K. (2024). Frontiers for Young Minds\nDOI: 10.3389/frym.2024.1284583"

Data sets from camera traps can be used to describe the patterns and monitor the occupancy, abundance, and richness of wildlife, essential information for conservation in times of rapid climate and land-cover changes. Habitat loss and poaching are responsible for historical population losses of mammals in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, especially for medium to large-sized species. Here we present a data set from camera trap surveys of medium to large-sized native mammals (&gt;1kg) across the Atlantic Forest. We compiled data from 5380 ground-level camera trap deployments in 3046 locations, from 2004 to 2020, resulting in 43,068 records of 58 species. These data add to existing data sets of mammals in the Atlantic Forest by including dates of camera operation needed for analyses dealing with imperfect detection. We also included, when available, information on important predictors of detection, namely the camera brand and model, use of bait, and obstruction of camera viewshed that can be measured from example pictures at each camera location. Besides its application in studies on the patterns and mechanisms behind occupancy, relative abundance, richness, and detection, the data set presented here can be used to study species’ daily activity patterns, activity levels, and spatiotemporal interactions between species. Moreover, data can be used combined with other data sources in the multiple and expanding uses of integrated population modeling. An R script is available to view summaries of the data set.

    "title": "Communal tapir latrines are foraging sites for tropical forest vertebrates",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Foraging is essential for animal survival, as it provides the nutritional resources to sustain metabolism and all activities that animals undertake. Communal latrines are sites where multiple individuals of the same species defecate and can have multiple functions. Latrine behavior has been recorded in many animal species, including lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), which consume a wide variety of plants and fruits and defecate large piles of dung, sometimes containing many seeds. Due to the concentration of seeds and other defecated material, latrines may thus serve as direct sources of food for other vertebrates, including insectivores feeding on invertebrates attracted to dung. Here, we studied which vertebrate animals were recorded foraging in tapir latrines, how long they spent foraging on latrines, and how their foraging behavior varied with the time of day and days since tapir defecation. Since tapirs are generalist foragers with a large diet breadth, we expected that their feces might attract vertebrate foragers with a variety of dietary habits (e.g., frugivores, granivores, omnivores, insectivores) in distinct foraging periods within a day. We also expected that the foraging events would be greatest in the days immediately following tapir defecation. We monitored 27 tapir latrines with camera traps for six months, recording foraging vs. non-foraging behaviors. We observed nine vertebrate species foraging in tapir latrines with five frequent foragers: the frugivores Guerlinguetus brasiliensis (50% of total foraging records) and Tinamus solitarius (16%, also a granivore) and the omnivores Turdus albicollis (18%), Chamaeza campanisona (10%) and Odontophorus capueira (6%). Foraging and nonforaging events throughout the day differed significantly for G. brasiliensis (p= 0.006), T. solitarius (p= 0.01), and C. campanisona (p= 0.001), and all species were diurnal, foraging between 05:00 h and 18:00 h. The foraging probability of C. campanisona and T. albicollis was affected by the time lapse since tapir defecation. Our study highlights that communal latrines such as those maintained by lowland tapirs can be an important resource supply for some vertebrate consumers with different diets and could contribute to maintaining diversity in tropical forests. We call for future studies to inspect the importance of latrines as foraging sites for other species and ecosystems.\nLAUTENSCHLAGER, L., SOUZA, Y., VILLAR, N., GALETTI, M., & FEELEY, K. (2024).

    "text": "An often-overlooked question of the biodiversity crisis is how natural hazards contribute to species extinction risk. To address this issue, we explored how four natural hazards, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and volcanoes, overlapped with the distribution ranges of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles that have either narrow distributions or populations with few mature individuals. To assess which species are at risk from these natural hazards, we combined the frequency and magnitude of each natural hazard to estimate their impact. We considered species at risk if they overlapped with regions where any of the four natural hazards historically occurred (n = 3,722). Those species with at least a quarter of their range subjected to a high relative impact were considered at high risk (n = 2,001) of extinction due to natural hazards. In total, 834 reptiles, 617 amphibians, 302 birds, and 248 mammals were at high risk and they were mainly distributed on islands and in the tropics. Hurricanes (n = 983) and earthquakes (n = 868) affected most species, while tsunamis (n = 272), and volcanoes (n = 171) affected considerably fewer. The region with the highest number of species at high risk was the Pacific Ring of Fire, especially due to volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis, while hurricane-related high-risk species were concentrated in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and northwestern Pacific Ocean. Our study provides important information regarding the species at risk due to natural hazards and can help guide conservation attention and efforts to safeguard their survival.\nGONÇALVES, F., FAROOQ, H., HARFOOT, M., PIRES, M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many plants benefit from seed dispersal by frugivorous animals. This mutualistic interaction depends largely on interaction-relevant matching of functional traits (i.e. fruit size of plants and gape size of frugivores). With declines in large-bodied animal populations, it is likely that fruit–frugivore interactions have eroded, leading to the loss of seed dispersal of large-fruited plants. Such erosion could be especially evident in vulnerable island ecosystems such as those in the Caribbean, where most large-bodied frugivore populations have collapsed due to human activities. Here, we aim to understand the consequences of this decline by first quantifying gaps in frugivory function between common, smaller frugivores (birds, smaller reptiles, and bats) and rarer or regionally extinct, larger reptiles (Cyclura spp. and Chelonoidis spp.) in the Caribbean archipelagos. We then assess the benefits of reestablishing these interactions by determining the effects of large reptile ingestion on seed germination for 10 fruiting species, representing a range of fruit sizes, native to the Caribbean. We found that there are significant gaps in frugivory function, with smaller frugivores having many times smaller mean gape sizes than larger reptiles. Furthermore, we found that most fruiting species used in this study could germinate after being consumed by large reptiles, with two species having their germination speed significantly accelerated post-ingestion. These results indicate that fruiting plants could benefit from reestablishing frugivorous interactions between larger reptiles and fruiting plants. Given the existing gap in frugivory function, additional attention should be given to the possibility of rewilding defaunated islands to restore plant–frugivore networks.\nKIM, S., LAUTENSCHLAGER, L., TARAZONA-TUBENS, F.
