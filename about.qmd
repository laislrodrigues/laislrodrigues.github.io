## {{< fa pen-to-square >}} academically speaking...

I have a Bachelor's degree in Ecology (2012-2016) at  the São Paulo State University (UNESP), in my hometown Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazil. For my undergraduate thesis, I joined the Conservation Biology Lab (LABIC) with Dr. Mauro Galetti, where I developed my first research that aimed to understand the ecological role of frugivory and seed dispersal by the Red-footed tortoise *Chelonoidis carbonaria*.

Installing camera traps was a huge part of my Masters and Ph.D. life

After that, I obtained a Master's degree in Ecology and Biodiversity (2017-2019) at the same university and supervisor. My research focused on evaluating the effect of pasture landscapes and livestock presence in the richness and diversity of medium and large-sized terrestrial mammals in the Atlantic Forest fragments through São Paulo state. It was extensive hours driving across the state, knowing special places, dealing with land owners and farmers, and installing dozens of camera traps.

    Hmmmm, "Ecology, Science + Conservation", let's go!
</p>

For my next step, I moved out of my comfort zone to pursue a Ph.D. in Biology at the University of Miami. I'm part of Dr. Kenneth Feeley's lab [Jungle Biology lab](https://www.junglebiology.org/). My current project aims to understand the ecological role of Lowland tapirs ( *Tapirus terrestris* ) in the Atlantic Forest, focusing on their dietary preferences and functional diversity, latrines' use by different vertebrate community to obtain food resources, and finally, understand the importance of latrines as nutrient sources for plants species germination and recruitment. 


## {{< fa heart >}} him...

I'm a very simple woman with easy ways to please me: cold beer, good coffee, travels, nice food, my family and friends, my pets, and general nerd stuff. I also really enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking, birdwatching, and to photograph nature around me!

Almost 13 years ago I found my best friend, my partner, and nowadays, my husband. I was so lucky to find another ecologist, a brilliant scientist, a super nerd with the kindest heart - and since then, we are sharing this crazy life together.

## {{< fa earth-americas >}} resilience & resistance 

In 2020, in the middle of the pandemic (COVID-19), I got accepted to pursue my Ph.D. in the University of Miami, FL, USA. After one year doing everything remotely, in 2021 I finally got my student visa and bought a one-way ticket to Miami!

It was my first time traveling to another country completely by myself. Also my first time in which I would rely completely on my English (thanks to years of 'CCAA' language course!) and communication/survival skills. 
I must say, it was/is not easy. Miami has this wild vibe, and full of 'latinos' everywhere - at least my Spanish definitely improved. It is a total different experience living in another country with distinct costumes, cuisine, rules, and AC at home 24h a day.

Anyway, I would say I adapted - as much as I could.
Even doing my project in Brazil and traveling there for a few months every year, Miami do not scare me anymore (just a little bit). 
Yuri also applied and moved here with me in 2022, and now we can call this place as "home" (temporarily) :)
