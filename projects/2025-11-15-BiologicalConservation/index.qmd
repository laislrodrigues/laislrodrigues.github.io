Large mammals play an important role in ecosystem functioning, yet the loss of natural vegetation cover due to
conversion to agriculture and other land uses has pushed wildlife into small and impoverished habitats. Thus, it
is paramount to understand how landscape structure enables large mammals to thrive in tropical rainforests. We
surveyed 42 forest landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic forest for lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) using camera
traps, analyzed landscape structure based on thematic maps, and assessed the matrix vegetation heterogeneity
using satellite image texture. To evaluate the multiscale effects of the predictive variables on the species’
occurrence probability, we used a single-season occupancy approach. Beyond advancing the understanding of
the species’ habitat requirements in human-modified landscapes, we used the species as a model to test theoretical
predictions about the scale of effect (SoE), which have yet to be empirically evaluated. Habitat loss and
fragmentation per se reduced the lowland tapir’s occurrence, as did matrix vegetation heterogeneity. Different
landscape metrics influenced species occupancy at distinct spatial scales, and the SoE of fragmentation metrics
was not smaller than habitat amount. Habitat fragmentation at a wide scale was the main predictor of species
occupancy probability. Our findings highlight the critical role of habitat spatial structure in shaping the distribution
of the lowland tapir in human-modified landscapes. Beyond protecting large forest remnants, it is recommended
to increase landscape connectivity at a broad scale through ecosystem restoration efforts to safeguard
the species’ persistence in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
