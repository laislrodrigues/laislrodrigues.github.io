# Poop Is Cool! Animal “Bathrooms” Help Animals And Plants

Many animals eat fruits and then get rid of any seeds that they swallow through defecation (pooping). This can be good for plants because it moves seeds around, and the seeds can grow into new plants using the dung (poop) as compost. In some cases, many animals will poop in the same spot, creating “bathroom” areas called latrines that help them to bond with other individuals of their species, communicate, and mark their home regions. These latrines can also attract many other animals that eat seeds, insects, and even poop. Unfortunately, humans are causing many animals to become less common or even extinct as we destroy their habitats or hunt them for food and fur. If we lose these animals, we also lose all the good things they do for nature. We must protect natural habitats so these important animals can keep living—and pooping!
